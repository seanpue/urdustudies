      <p class="style1"><strong>RAJINDER SINGH BEDI </strong> was born in Sialkot in 1915. He first worked as a clerk in the postal department; later he joined the Lahore office of All India Radio and wrote many successful plays, having meanwhile established himself as a highly nuanced fiction writer with the publication of <em>Dana-o-Dam</em>, his first collection of short stories. On Partition he moved to India. After working for a short period as Station Director for Radio Kashmir, he joined the Mumbai film industry producing and writing scripts for a number of successful films. His Urdu novel, <em>Ek Chadar Maili Si</em>, translated into English as <em>I Take This Woman, </em>received the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1965. Bedi, who died in 1984, is regarded as the second most prominent Urdu fiction writer after Sa'adat Hasan Manto.</p>
