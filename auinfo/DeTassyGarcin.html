The AUS will also publish reviews of books, an annual inventory of significant Western publications in the field, reports, research-in-progress, notices, and information on forthcoming events of interest to its readers (conferences, workshops, competitions, awards, etc.). Each issue of the AUS will also include a section in the Urdu script featuring old and new writing.">

          <p class="Ausau"><strong>GARCIN DE TASSY</strong> (1794-1878) was a French Orientalist interested in Middle Eastern and Indian languages, Islamic culture and philosophy, and Islamic mysticism. Most of his research is devoted to linguistic and literary issues related to Urdu--a language that he learned without ever setting foot in India or having much direct contact with its native speakers.</p>
