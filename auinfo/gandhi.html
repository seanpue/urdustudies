        GANDHI </b>(born Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi; 1869&#150;1948) was an Indian 
        nationalist and spiritual leader. In his opposition to the British rule 
        he pursued a policy of passive resistance and non-violent civil disobedience. 
        He was president of the Indian National Congress (1925&#150;34) and although 
        he never held government office, he was regarded as the country's supreme 
        political and spiritual leader. He was assassinated by a Hindu fundamentalist 
        who was outraged by Gandhi&#146;s agreement to the creation of the state 
        of Pakistan.</font></td>
