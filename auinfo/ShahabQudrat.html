        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>QUDRATULLAH 
          SHAHAB</b> was born in Gilgit in 1917 and spent his childhood in Jammu. 
          He worked for some time in the civil service of India and later, after 
          Partition, joined the civil service of Pakistan where he held numerous 
          offices including that of Ambassador to the Netherlands. He is, however, 
          best known to Urdu readers as a master short-story writer and the main 
          architect of the Pakistan Writers&#146; Guild, a government-sponsored 
          agency for the organization and aid of Pakistani writers. His published 
          works include two collections of short stories and <i>Ya Khuda!</i>&#151;a 
          novella about the problem of rehabilitating the refugees made homeless 
          in the wake of India&#146;s Partition. He died in 1986 shortly after 
          completing his voluminous autobiography <i>Shahabnama.</i> </font></p>
