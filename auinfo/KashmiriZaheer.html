      <p class="style1"><strong>ZAHEER KASHMIRI</strong> (1919-1994) was a committed Marxist, a Progressive poet and activist, and a literary critic. He came under the influence of the Progressive Writers' Movement (PWM) quite early in his life and, in turn, left an enduring influence on it. He was imprisoned in 1950 while serving as one of the editors for the literary magazine <em>Savera</em> (Lahore), then the mouthpiece of the PWM.      </p>
