        AFZAAL ALI</b>&#146;s real name was Kaneez Abbas but she was better known 
        as Akbari Begum. She was born sometime in the 1860s. She was an aunt of 
        the famous Urdu novelist Qurratulain Hyder&#146;s mother. Her family hailed 
        from Lucknow, moved to Muradabad and, later, owing to her father&#146;s 
        government employment, to Panjab. Her first novel, published by Public 
        Press, Muradabad, was<i> Guldasta-e Muhabbat </i>which was written under 
        the pseudonym &#147;Abbas Murtaza.&#148; This novel is now very rare. 
        Qurratulain Hyder believes she has the only remaining copy. Akbari Begum 
        wrote two other novels, <i>Sho&#145;la-e Pinhaan</i> and &#145;Iffat-e 
        Nisvaan, before <i>Goodar ka La&#145;l</i>, which was first published 
        in 1907. The latter created a furor immediately upon publication but quickly 
        acquired a special place among middle-class Muslim women and was usually 
        included as an item in their dowries.</font></div>
