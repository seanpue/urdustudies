          LONSDALE</b> was born in 1955 in England. She moved to Spain some years 
          ago and studied English philology at the University of Barcelona. After 
          completing a postgraduate course in Postcolonial Studies she became 
          interested in South Asian literature, particularly the literature of 
          Pakistan. Having completed an M.A., for which she researched the history 
          of Pakistani literature, she is now working on her doctoral thesis concerning
