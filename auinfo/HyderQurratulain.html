        <p class="style1"><span class="AUSau"><strong>QURRATULAIN HYDER</strong> (1926-2007) is regarded as the most celebrated woman writer of the Subcontinent. Her published works include six novels, many novellas, and several collections of short stories, literary criticism, and translations into Urdu of such writers as Henry James, T.S. Eliot, and Truman Capote. In 1968 the Sahitya Akademi awarded her a prize for her collection of short stories <em>Patjhar ki Avaz </em>(The Sound of Falling Leaves). Her controversial voluminous novel <em>Aag ka Darya</em> -- which was specially mentioned by the Nobel Laureate J.M.G. Le Clezio as among his favorite works -- has been translated into fifteen Indian languages, along with a reworking in English by her as the <em>River of Fire</em>. In 1979-80 she was writer-in-residence for the International Writers Program of the University of Iowa. She received the Jnanpith Award in 1989 and  the<em> Padma Bhushan</em> in 2005 from the Government of India for her outstanding contribution to Urdu literature. </span></p>
