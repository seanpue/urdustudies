          <p class="Ausau"><strong>AMIQ HANAFI</strong> is a modern Urdu poet who was associated with All India Radio. His poetic works--among them, <em>Sindbad</em>, <em>Shajar-e-Sada</em> and <em>Salasalatu 'l-Jaras</em>--are a testimony to his quest for new lyrical sensibilities that resonate with the poetic demands of contemporary times. A perceptive critic, he also wrote a biography in Hindi of the classical vocalist Ustad Rajab 'Ali Khan. He left a work on Sufism incomplete at the time of his death.</p>
