       <meta name="description" content="The aim of the Annual Urdu Studies is to provide a forum for scholars working on Urdu humanities in the broadest sense in which to publish scholarly articles, translations, and views. The AUS will also publish reviews of books, an annual inventory of significant Western publications in the field, reports, research-in-progress, notices, and information on forthcoming events of interest to its readers (conferences, workshops, competitions, awards, etc.). Each issue of the AUS will also include a section in the Urdu script featuring old and new writing.">
