          FAZL SIDDIQI</b> was born in Badayun, India, in 1908. A versatile and 
          prolific writer, he drew his characters from the rural and feudal environment 
          of India and portrayed them with engaging realism. His published works 
          include ten collections of short stories, four novels, four novellas, 
          a book of biographical sketches, a book on gardening, and a translation 
          of George Orwell&#146;s novel 1984. His short story &#147;Charhtaa Suraj&#148; 
          was the recipient of a UNESCO International Award in 1957. He died in 
          Karachi in 1986.</font></div>
