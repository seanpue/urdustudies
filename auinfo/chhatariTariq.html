          CHHATARI</b> worked with All India Radio for close to a decade before 
          joining Aligarh Muslim University as Reader in the Department of Urdu. 
          He published <i>Baagh kaa Darvaazaa,</i> his first collection of stories, 
          in 2001. He also edited a volume of Urdu-Hindi stories, <i>Jadeed Afsaana,</i> 
          in 1992. His stories generally deal with the dilemmas of modern life, 
          the stresses and strains encountered in human relationships and the 
          little cameos that are often overlooked by those who paint the larger 
          picture.</font></div>
